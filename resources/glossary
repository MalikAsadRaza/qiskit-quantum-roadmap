# Glossary

| Term | Simple meaning |
|---|---|
| **Qubit** | Quantum bit; can be in a superposition of \|0⟩ and \|1⟩. |
| **Superposition** | A state like \( \alpha\|0⟩ + \beta\|1⟩ \), measured probabilistically. |
| **Measurement** | Converts a quantum state into a classical outcome (e.g., counts). |
| **Entanglement** | Non-classical correlation between qubits (e.g., Bell states). |
| **Gate** | Operation that transforms a qubit state (e.g., H, X, CNOT). |
| **Noise / Decoherence** | Unwanted interaction with the environment that degrades quantum information. |
| **Trap-Ion** | Qubits encoded in ions trapped in vacuum and controlled with lasers. |
| **Phonon** | Quantized collective vibration mode (acts like an interaction “bus” in ion traps). |
| **Superconducting Qubit** | Qubit encoded in superconducting circuit states at millikelvin temperatures. |
| **Josephson Junction** | Two superconductors separated by a thin insulator; provides nonlinearity used to form qubits. |
| **LC Circuit** | Inductor + capacitor resonator; a basic oscillator building block in circuits. |
