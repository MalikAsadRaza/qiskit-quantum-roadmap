# Glossary (Quick)

- **Qubit:** Quantum bit; can be in superposition of |0⟩ and |1⟩.
- **Superposition:** State α|0⟩ + β|1⟩, measured probabilistically.
- **Measurement:** Converts quantum state to classical outcome (counts).
- **Entanglement:** Non-classical correlation between qubits (e.g., Bell states).
- **Gate:** Operation that transforms the qubit state (e.g., H, X, CNOT).
- **Noise / Decoherence:** Unwanted interaction with environment that destroys quantum information.
- **Trap-Ion:** Qubits encoded in ions trapped in vacuum and controlled with lasers.
- **Phonon:** Quantized collective vibration mode (used as interaction “bus” in ion traps).
- **Superconducting qubit:** Qubit encoded in superconducting circuit states at millikelvin temperatures.
- **Josephson junction:** Two superconductors separated by thin insulator; enables nonlinearity used to form qubits.
- **LC circuit:** Inductor + capacitor resonator; base oscillator structure in many circuits.
